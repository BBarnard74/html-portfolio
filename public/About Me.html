<p>I'm a Family man (2 Daughters 6 and 10-years), I'm a Godly man that's lives by the following principles:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
   <li>God first</li>
   <li>Family (My Misses and kids)</li>
   <li>Protector of my Family</li>
   <li>Empathy and Love</li>
   <li>Useful</li>
</ol>
    
    When I'm not working or studying, I'm spending time with my Fianc√© and kids making memories.
    I enjoy reading, rugby, soccer and hitting the gym to let off some steam and it keeps me focused. 
    I try to enjoy every moment and control the controllables
    .</p>
    
    <p>My passion to become a Web Developer was always rooted in me. In 2023 I decided to take on this challenge
        and prove to myself that I can do it and that if you put your mind, focus and passion into something that you love and use to make a difference in your life and others.....the time was
        now or never.

    <p>This has been challenging with having a full time job, running the household with my misses (My pillar of strength) raising 2 girls for a future that is 
        unknown to us 15-20 years from now. I pray daily for my girls, praying that they achieve greatness, push themselves, don't get comfortable and grow from strength to strength. 
        I pray that I'm an amazing role model for them and that they know that I love them dearly. It's my kids and Candice who keep me going and find myself having this need to become more and do more.
